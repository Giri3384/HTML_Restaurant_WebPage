        <ul>
            <li><i>I grew up in a village near Karaikudi, homeland of the popular Chettinadu cuisine. When I was a kid, I used to go fishing in the nearby canals and bring home whatever meager catch I could manage and my grandmother would cook those fishes lovingly for me.  That's my most cherished food memory. What made the meal so special was the love and care in the cooking process. Since then I have been nurturing the passion to share my beautiful food experiences with the world.</i></li><br />
